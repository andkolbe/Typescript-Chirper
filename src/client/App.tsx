// BrowserRouter can be renamed anything
// think of Switch like a switch board
// Route is self closing
// Route always has two props attached to it, path and component
// path reads the url bar
// you tell component which component you want to show up on the path
// Route paths need to have the word exact or they will only route in alphbetical order
// Link replaces any anchor or button element that has to lead you to a different page
// Link needs to have a prop called 'to' that needs to a string of some kind
// you can render NavBar above Switch. Switch acts like the body of the page
// NavBar won't re render because it is above the Switch

// hitting enter on a url bar executes a GET request to a server
